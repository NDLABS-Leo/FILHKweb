f_filhk-about: FIL Hong Kong will take place from April 5- 8 across two key
  spaces, the Hong Kong Web3 Festival and the FIL Hong Kong Network Base.
  <br><br> The week will feature lightning talks, workshops, and plenty of
  coworking space, for those deep in the Filecoin ecosystem and those looking to
  discover the world of FVM. Attend the Hong Kong Web3 Festival and check out
  the Filecoin x IPFS booth, or drop by the FIL Hong Kong Network Base to meet
  with fellow innovators and work on driving Web3 forward. And if you’re a
  Filecoin Storage Provider or want to explore decentralized storage for your
  business, make sure to register for the FIL Hong Kong. <br><br> We’re bringing
  together developers, storage providers, clients, and ecosystem partners in one
  of the world’s emerging hubs for Web3 innovation. See you in HK!
