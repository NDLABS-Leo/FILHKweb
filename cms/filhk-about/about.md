f_filhk-about:
  "FIL Hong Kong hosted by NDLabs will take place across two locations: the FIL Hong Kong Network Base (April 5 to 7) and the FIL Hong Kong stage at Web3 Festival (April 8). <b>Two separate applications are required to attend these events, so be sure to apply for both!</b>
  <br><br> Join us at FIL Hong Kong for storage provider-focused lightning talks, workshops, and plenty of coworking space for the Filecoin ecosystem! If you’re a Filecoin storage provider or want to explore decentralized storage for your business, join us for two days of exciting talks focused on Web3 trends, decentralized storage, DePIN, and more. <br><br> We look forward to bringing together developers, storage providers, clients, and ecosystem partners in one of the world’s emerging hubs for Web3 innovation!"
